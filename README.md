# Python-to-cpp-or-java-in-programming-contest

This is a small repo with tools and concept for those looking to change from python to C++ and/or java for programming contests.


Starting the language change from Python to C++ or java for programming contests, has three main differences that could be challenging at first: 
- [x] Using parenthesis
- [x] Ending sentences
- [x] Data types.
- [x] Indentation vs brackets.
- [x] Reading data 
- [x] Printing data.

# Using parenthesis
In Python we are use to just not using parenthesis in conditionals and loops, but in C++ and java these are mandatory and will produce a lot of compiling error if not used.

# Ending sentences
In Java and C++ practically all sentences and flow and data construction should be ended either by a bracket (}) or by a semicolon (;), this could be specially frustrating in C++ because the compiler warnings and errors are not so specific and precise as the ones in java and even far more obscures that the ones in Python.

# Data types
In python we are used to just declare, initialize and or use variables without declaring its type (https://realpython.com/python-data-types/), this is because the type is declared during the interpretation. In C++ (https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/variables/ ) and java(https://www.javatpoint.com/java-variables ) we usually specify the types when declaring a variable. Although, there are workarounds for this in both C++ (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/auto-cpp?view=msvc-170 ) and java (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/var-keyword-in-java/), but somehow we always must at least use a reserved word to declare a variable, auto in c++ or var in java for example.

# Control structures and loops one liners:
In python we do not use brackets {} to group lines of code in the same level, we use indentation, but in C++ and java we must use brackets, but, we also can do one liners if we omit the brackets, for example in C++:

```
 for( int i = 0; i < 10; ++i )
   if( i%2 == 0 )
     cout << "Even" << endl;
   else
     cout << "Odd" << endl;
```

is equivalent to:

```
 for( int i = 0; i < 10; ++i ) {
   if( i%2 == 0 ) {
     cout << "Even" << endl;
   }
   else {
     cout << "Odd" << endl;
   } 
 }
```

Substitute the “cout” lines by System.out.println() and that code is just java:

```
 for( int i = 0; i < 10; ++i ) 
   if( i%2 == 0 ) 
     System.out.println("Even")
   else
     System.out.println("Odd")
```

Is equivalent to:

```
 for( int i = 0; i < 10; ++i ) {
   if( i%2 == 0 ) {
     System.out.println("Even")
   }
   else {
     System.out.println("Odd")
   } 
 }
```

# Reading data
In python we are used to reading data line by line, either using input(), raw_input(), sys.stdin and other tools, but it is generally used to read line by line. In C++ and Java we have multiple tools to read either line by line, or token by token, as a general good practice, is better to stick to reading all the input in a problem’s solution line by line or all the input token by token, but not mixing the two ways in the same solution to a problem, mainly because the new line character will be enoing to dealt with.  

In this repo you will find several templates to read data from standard input in C++ and java. Their names are quite self explanatory, those are just a couple of ways for reading data on each language.

When reading line by line, java offers a couple of tools much more simpler to tokenize or split a string into tokens (words). This will be the split() method and the StringTokenizer. After tokenizing, many times we need to transform strings to native data types (int, long, double, etc) or vice versa, and in Java is also quite straightforward using their wrapper classes (Integer, Long, Double, etc) and the plus operator (+) to concatenate native types to Strings. In C++, those tasks are a bit less straightforward, as always there are many ways to do it, but this methods could help a lot:

In this file https://github.com/niquefa/python-to-cpp-or-java/blob/main/LineByLineWithTestCases.cpp you will find some useful function to process strings in C++.

# Printing Data

The main difference you will notice going from python to C++ or Java in printing data, is that in python we are used to always getting a new line for each call to print(). Although we have a workaround in python to not print the new line, and is use print(“Some message or variable”, end=””) or to use import sys and sys.stdout.write("Hello there!") , but in C++ and java is the other way around, we must explicitly print the new line:

In C++ we usually use “endl” to print a new line:

cout << “Some message or variable” << answer << endl;

And in Java we use either System.out.println(“Some message or variable”) for printing with newline, or System.out.print(“Some message or variable”) to print without newline.

Additionally to these hints about printing in C++ and Java, there are some special tools in both languages for printing with even more speed.

In java we can use StringBuilder to build the answer before printing it and saving time in the process, this is suggested for problems with many data to print.

In C++ we have also several tools to fast printing data, but that is not so necessary for the huge majority of cases in programming competitions: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18412164/fast-c-string-output 

# Extra notes on java
As a rule, every java program in a programming contest should have a class and the method main inside that class, and generally that class name should have a specific name, in sites as uva online judge generally is Main, and in contest icpc style generally have should have a specific name related to the problem identification letter or name, make sure your program meets that requirement or you will get a compilation error. .
